Yes, a UX designer can have a stake in the business depending on the specific circumstances and the structure of the organization. Here are a few scenarios where a UX designer might have a stake in the business:

Startups and Small Businesses: In startup environments, it's common for team members, including UX designers, to receive equity or ownership shares as part of their compensation package. This is often done to align their interests with the success of the business and provide incentives for long-term commitment and dedication.

Co-founders: In some cases, UX designers may be involved in founding a business and hold a co-founder position. As co-founders, they have a direct stake in the business and share responsibilities and decision-making authority, including strategic decisions related to UX design.

Consulting and Freelancing: UX designers who work as independent consultants or freelancers may negotiate arrangements where they receive a percentage of the project's revenue or profits. This can be in addition to or instead of a fixed fee, allowing them to share in the business outcomes.

Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs): Some companies implement ESOPs, which grant employees, including UX designers, ownership shares in the company. ESOPs are often used to foster a sense of ownership, incentivize employees, and align their interests with the company's success.

It's important to note that the specific arrangements for a UX designer to have a stake in the business can vary widely based on the organization, its structure, and individual negotiations. It's advisable for UX designers to discuss these possibilities with the relevant stakeholders and seek legal and financial advice when considering such arrangements.
